# EPO full-text for humans


The purpose of this project is to let you explore the **EP full-text data for text analytics (CC4)** in a minute.

- ðŸš§ WiP ðŸš§: We have prepared the data for you. You can start exploring the full database using **BigQuery** right now. Efficient full-scale analysis is literally one click away from you.
- [Developers](set-up.md): This project is based on a standard **ETL** pipeline. Advanced users can build on it to design their own implementation and/or set options that are most convenient to them.

This is an open-source project ([MIT-2](./license.md)).
